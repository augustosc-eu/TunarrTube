## vexp <!-- vexp v3.1.1 -->

### Context strategy: call run_pipeline ONCE at task start
If the task already names the files/symbols to touch, SKIP vexp. Otherwise one
`run_pipeline({ "task": "..." })` returns ranked pivot files with line ranges and
blast radius. Do NOT open files one by one to find your way around - every extra
tool call costs a turn. Call it again ONLY when the task moves to a new area.
`get_skeleton` for files to understand, not edit. `verify_done` before calling a
multi-file task complete, then RUN the tests it names.

### Query shape (do this)
Anchor the task on real identifiers (ClassName, functionName) or file paths:
`run_pipeline({ "task": "fix JWT expiry in AuthService.validateToken" })`

vexp runs entirely on this machine, index in `.vexp/`;
`run_pipeline` transmits nothing to any external service.
On `status: "degraded"` or 0 pivots the index is still building - use your own tools.
For literal string sweeps use your native search - do NOT route text sweeps through vexp.
Repo SOURCE only: logs, dist/, node_modules/ and files outside the repo are NOT indexed.
